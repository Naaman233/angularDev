This project is a e commerce platform using angular development to create different components to run a shopping application
I will be using the angular/cli to create these various component 
I will be using css and bootstrap for the styling of this project 
I may switch to node.js for the backend development of this platform

To install bootstrap in your node_modules, run the following commands 
firstly quit the development server using ctrl + c and then using the terminal run
> npm install --save bootstrap
this will locally install bootstrap into your node_modules folder. 
To declare bootstrap globally, locate your angular.json folder, In it you will see an array that houses all your styling properties. Copy the file path of the bootstap from the node_modules folder into it and start your server again to ensure that bootstrap is globally added.
